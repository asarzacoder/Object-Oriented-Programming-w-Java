USER-DEFINED METHODS NOTES
---------------------------------------------- Ways of program development ---------------------------------------------
    Modular development -> process of dividing a program into a separate modules that can be developed and tested
    separately and then integrated into a single program.

    Incremental development -> process in which a programmer writes, compiles and tests small amount of codes. (Repeat).

    Method stub -> method definition whose statements have not yet been written.
        Notes: Use method stubs to capture high-level behavior of main() and the required method before diving
        into details of each method.
--------------------------------------------------- Basics of Methods --------------------------------------------------
Method Definition -> public static double calcPizzaArea() { BODY }
    - Must be defined within a class.
    - Public means it can be called from any class in the program.
    - Static means the method only uses values that are passed to the method.

Method Call -> calcPizzaArea();

Return -> A method may return one value using a return statement.

Parameters ->
    - Parameter is a method input specified in a method definition.

                                                     PARAMETER
        (Ex. public static double calcPizzaArea(double pizzaDiameter) { BODY }
    - Argument is a value provided to a method's parameter during a method call. (Ex. calcPizzaArea(12.0)).

----------------------------------------------------- Unit Testing -----------------------------------------------------
Notes: Good practice is to test small parts of the program individually, before testing the entire program.

1. Create a testBench aka test harness.
   Purpose -> Check that a method returns correct output values for a variety of input values.
   Notes -> Each unique set of input values is known as test vector.
            Assertions need to be enabled as virtual machine arguments on the command line or in your IDE.

A better test harness would only print a message for incorrect output.
ASSERT -> Java provides a compact way to print an error message when an expression evaluates to false.
       -> assert testExpression : detailedMessage;

       ex. Before -> System.out.println("0:0, expecting 0, got " + hrMinToMin(0, 0));
           After -> assert (hrMinToMin(0, 0) == 0) : "Assertion (hrMinToMin(0, 0) == 0) failed";

Notes -> Assertion is not enabled by default. Must execute Java programs with additional command-line options.
            -> java -ea HrMinToMinTestHarness

2. Using branches for unit test.

        if (hrMinToMin(0, 0) != 0) {
            System.out.println("0:0, expecting0, got " + hrMinToMin(0, 0));
        }

-------------------------------------------------- Scanner In Methods --------------------------------------------------
Notes:
    1. A program should only have one Scanner per input stream. A good practice is to create a single Scanner object in
       main() and passes the Scanner to another method.

            method call -> "Pizza has " + getPizzaCalories(scnr) + "calories.";
            method definition -> public static double getPizzaCalories(Scanner scnr){}

-------------------------------------------- Java Documentation for methods --------------------------------------------
Notes:
    - Good practice is to include doc comment for every method, having at least an overall description,
      a @param block tag for each parameter and @return block tag if not void.

JavaDoc ->
    - Tool that parses specially formatted multi-line comments to generate program documentation in HTML format.
    - Doc comments begin with /** and end with */

Tags Section ->
    - Consists of block tags, each of the form @ keyword plus text having its own line.

    @author     <- list the item's author
    @version    <- indicates the items version (typically fo a program)
    @param      <- describes a method parameters type, purpose, etc.
    @return     <- describes a method's return type, purpose, or void.
    @see        <- refers to relevant information like a website, or another method.
